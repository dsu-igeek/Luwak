{"name":"Luwak","tagline":"Java FUSE FS interface layer","body":"Luwak is yet another FUSE interface for Java.  Why create yet another FUSE Java interface?  Other projects were largely dead or \r\nrelied too much on native code or didn't give a good Java style interface.\r\n\r\nLuwak is almost pure Java.  There is OS specific glue code and a native class that calls libc via JNA.  Luwak currently support Linux and OS X.\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\nTo build Luwak you will need the Luwak project and the iGeekCommon project.  These can both be checked out from GitHub.\r\n\r\n'cd Luwak\r\n\r\nant\r\n'\r\n\r\nThe output will be in output/lib/Luwak.jar\r\n\r\nThe examples will be in output/lib/LuwakExamples.jar\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDave Smith-Uchida (@dsu-igeek)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
